* Overview

This repo holds the configuration and setup for RaiseNow forms used by
BOS Schweiz. The configuration is maintained in YAML. Compared to
JSON, YAML is easier to read and edit, more powerful (e.g. merge
keys), and can include comments, and thus can easily be documented
inline.

There is a Makefile to build the project to =public= and deploy the
project to bos-schweiz.ch hosting on AWS (seven49). CI is set up, so
pushes to the master branch will trigger a deploy automatically.
